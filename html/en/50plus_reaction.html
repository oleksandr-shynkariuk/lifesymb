                <br/><b>Short description:</b> : The ReAction course is an important step on the way to
                physical mastery. With the aid of our ReAction trainer it is possible to simulate
                real life situations such as falling forward, falling backwards, jumping and flying.
                The participants will also learn more advanced Wing Tsun techniques and train
                them even blindfold. Everything is guided by our certified instructors, which turns
                the course into a unique experience.

                When muscle recruitment is less than optimal, that can be a sign of anything
                from injury to compensation to poor motor learning. If a person doesn’t use the
                movements that are available, then they will be forgotten. Especially in higher
                ages, when the ability to react fast is decreasing, it is important to put the body
                in uncertain situations. By doing so the body has to react, rather than anticipate
                (this is the ability of the body to predict a future situation), and increases the
                array of possible solutions to challenging tasks in the daily life.

                Our reaction trainer consists of elastic straps, which are spread over two sides.
                Depending on the participant’s body weight, one can also add or remove up to
                two bands on each side.
                <br/>
                To reduce the impact of the bodyweight on different movements, we choose
                exercises where the bands are working towards the gravity. This allows the
                participant to experience an ease in the body, and learn and train movements,
                speed and agility that would not have been possible otherwise.
