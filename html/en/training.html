        The design and progression of our Lifesymb training sessions is in balance
        with the basic training principles that have been stated by Sport Science
        literature. We think that every training person should be aware of these
        principles.
        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Specificity principle</h3>
        The specificity principle asserts that the best way to develop physical
        fitness for your sport is to train the energy systems and muscles as closely
        as possible to the way they are used in your sport.
        <br/>Thus, the best way to
        train for running is to run, for swimming is to swim, and for weightlifting is
        to lift. The training program should not only overload the energy systems
        and muscles used in that sport, but should also duplicate similar
        movement patterns. For example, in strengthening a quarterback’s
        throwing arm, design the exercise to simulate the throwing movement.
        <br/>Warning: This principle can be taken too far. Ample evidence suggests that
        cross training, or doing another sport or activity, can help improve
        performance (see the <i>variation principle</i>).
        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Overload</h3>
        To improve your fitness level, you must do more than what your bodies is
        used to. When more is demanded, within reason, the body adapts to the
        increased demand. You can apply overload in duration, intensity, or both. If
        you increase a cross country runner’s long-distance run by five minutes,
        you’ve added an overload of duration. If you instead ask the runner to run
        her normal distance but in a shorter amount of time, you’ve added an
        overload of intensity. Overloading can be achieved by following the
        acronym <b>FITT:</b>
        <br/>
        <b>• Frequency:</b> Increasing the number of times you train per week
        <br/>
        <b>• Intensity:</b> Increasing the difficulty of the exercise you do. For
        example running at 12 km/h instead of 10 or increasing the weight
        you are squatting with.
        <br/>
        <b>• Time:</b> Increasing the length of time that you are training for each
        session. For example cycling for 45 minutes instead of 30.
        <br/>
        <b>• Type:</b> Increase the difficulty of the training you are doing. For
        example progress from walking to running.

        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Progression</h3>
        To steadily improve your fitness level, you must continually increase the
        physical demands to overload their systems. The trick is to choose an
        intensity that is not too high and not too low. If the training demand is
        increased too quickly, you will be unable to adapt and may break down. If
        the demand is not adequate, you will not achieve optimal fitness levels.
        Our experienced trainers and coaches together with our Lifesymb
        technology are making sure that you are training in the optimal way to
        achieve your health and fitness goals fast.

        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Diminishing Returns</h3>
        When unfit athletes begin a training regime, their fitness levels improve
        rapidly, but as they become fitter, the diminishing returns principle
        becomes law. That is, as you become fitter, the amount of improvement is
        less as you approach your genetic limits. A corollary to this principle is that
        as fitness levels increase, more work or training is needed to make the
        same gains.

        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Moderation</h3>
        According Aristotle’s statement, find the golden middle, we can also apply
        this principle on training and health. Remember that training is a slow,
        gradual process. You want to gently coax your body into optimal condition,
        not beat yourself up by overtraining.<br/>
        Training should be fun. Especially when you take part in the LifeSymb
        courses you will find a comfortable and friendly environment, where you
        can make friends and increase your well-being. Our technology gives you
        an overview about your body and what is to do next.

        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Variation</h3>
        This principle has several meanings. After you have trained hard for
        several days, they should train lightly to give their bodies a chance to
        recover. Over the course of the year use our LifeSymb training cycles to
        vary the intensity and volume of your training. This principle also means
        that you should change the exercises or activities regularly so that you do
        not overstress some specific parts of the body. Of course changing
        activities also maintains your interest in training and new movements are
        valuable new experiences as well.<br/>
        Perhaps you’re thinking that the specificity principle and variation principle
        seem to be incompatible. The specificity principle states that the more
        specific the training to the demands of the sport, the better; and the
        variation principle seemingly asserts the opposite-train by using a variety
        of activities. The incompatibility is resolved by the degree to which each
        principle is followed. More specific training is better, but it can become
        exceedingly boring. Thus some variety that involves the same muscle
        groups is a useful change.

        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Reversibility</h3>
        We all know the following adage: Use it or lose it. When you stop training,
        your hard-won fitness gains disappear, usually faster than they were
        gained. The actual rate of decline depends on the length of the training
        period before detraining, the specific muscle group, and other factors. A
        person confined to complete bed rest is estimated to lose cardiovascular
        fitness at the rate of 10 percent a week. Smart coaches and athletes today
        recognize that maintaining a moderately high level of fitness year-round is
        easier than detraining at the end of the season and then retraining at the
        beginning of the next.

        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Individual Differecnes</h3>
        Every person is different and responds differently to the same training
        activities. The value of training depends partly on your maturation. Before
        puberty, training is less effective than after puberty. Other factors that
        affect how you respond to training include your individual pretraining
        condition; genetic predisposition; gender and race; diet and sleep; environmental factors such as heat, cold, and humidity; and of course
        motivation. Within the Lifesymb courses we will design the training mostly
        in courses. However, interactions within the courses are promoted, which
        gives the trainer the freedom to circulate and make individualized training
        within the group possible. Many exercises can be done in small groups or
        with only two persons. This provides an optimal environment for a
        convenient and effective training.
