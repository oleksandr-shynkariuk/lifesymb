        <b>The 50+ package is divided in 4 different programs:</b>

        <b><br/>-	Sensors
        <br/>-	Core
        <br/>-	Motion
        <br/>-	ReAction</b>
        <br/><br/>
        In the <b>Sensors course</b> the participants relearn to use their innate senses.
        Different surfaces, unstable ground and balance training is in the focus.
        The activation and training of the senses inside of the skin, makes every step more aware and
        it is the basis for our other courses within the 50+ package.
        <br/>The <b>Core program</b> is directed to increase the functional structure of the muscles in the middle of the body.
        Especially the abdominals and the back will be training during the course.
        We will also introduce the basic principles of the traditional Wing Tsun Kung Fu.
        This is a very soft and inspiring way of gaining confidence and stability.
        <br/>The <b>Motion course</b> increases the variety of possible movements of the participants.
        We will also work with coordinative tasks, which train the ability to concentrate.
        <br/>The <b>ReAction training</b>, different movement styles and elements from dancing, martial arts, athletics and
        ball games are used during this course. Finally we introduce the ReAction course as an important step on the way to physical mastery.
        <br/>With the aid of our ReAction trainer it is possible to simulate real life situations such as falling forward,
        falling backwards, jumping and flying. The participants will also learn more advanced Wing Tsun techniques and train them even blindfold.
        Everything is guided by our certified instructors, which turns the course into a unique experience.

        <br/><br/>
        <h3>Company Health</h3>
        LifeSymb Company Health is a program for companies who want to have healthy and happy workers.
        We offer training in combination with medical treatments in small groups.
        We also keep on track with the personal development of each trainee though our avatar technology.
        Our services range from pure training, over team building interventions until monitoring and a supervised training cycle.

        <br/>
        The cycle starts with the planning of the interventions and requirements for it.
        After the determination of the demands and the consideration of available options,
        the appropriate program will be chosen. Besides normal training sessions (silver program),
        is it possible to include a regular control and analysis cycle (gold program), to whether the applied methods were successful or not.

        <h3>Athlete</h3>
        In our opinion every human being is an athlete. Although it is clear that some of us have more advantageous genetics for certain tasks,
        we believe that only few people actually use the potential of what they are capable of. The Athlete program uses innovative technologies and
        methods that are designed to restore, and increase the individual performance of every person.
        <br/>In case you have been performing a certain Sport over a longer period you might have experienced an injury related to that.
        Usual rehabilitation based on stabilization training is often very unfunctional and can take quite a long time.
        This break can greatly decrease the performance of an athlete in comparison to the competition. Even if you never performed in a Sport,
        it is always more efficient to build up muscles and refine movements in a functional way.
        The Athlete program turns your rehab training into an unique experience, which doesnâ€™t only restore your performance.
        It even makes you better in a shorter time.

        Our technologies and methods are not only highly effective, they also provide a lot of fun. You can try our services for free and use them to achieve your personal goals, or you can just use them for fun.
