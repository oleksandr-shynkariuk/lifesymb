        <h4>Developed with professional athletes.</h4>
        <br/>
        The 4D PRO reaction trainer was developed by Dr Homayun Gharavi MD PHD PHD, Doctor of medicine and sports sciences.
        <br/>
        Dr Gharavi is the founder and head of The German Academy of Applied Sports Medicine.
        <br/>
        He has travelled the world as a team doctor
        and fitness coach to various Olympic
        teams since 1997. He is also a sought after
        guest speaker on international congresses.

        <h5>Designed to save time.</h5>
        <br/>
        After working with rigid suspension systems for many years, Dr Gharavi came to the conclusion that they were making his athletes slower instead of faster.
        <br/>
        "The problem with rigid systems: with every repetition the movement becomes slower - in athletics an absolutely senseless feature." - his search for a solution began...
        <br/>
        <br/>
        His idea was a device that worked all the
        muscles dynamically, to meet the demands
        of sports and everyday life. This trains the
        muscles to move faster and independently
        from eachother.
        <br/>
        It had to be simple,
        comfortable, effective, easy on the joints â€“
        and fun. The 4D PRO ReAction Trainer
        was born.
