                <br/><b>Short description:</b> The motion course increases the variety of possible
                movements of the participants. We will also work with coordinative tasks, which
                train the ability to concentrate. The ReAction training, different movement styles
                and elements from dancing, martial arts, gymnastics and ball games are used
                during this course.

                A key feature of our independence as human beings is mobility. We define mobility as the
                ability to independently and safely move oneself from one place to another. Mobility incorporates many types of tasks, including the ability to stand up from a bed or chair, to
                walk or run, and to navigate through often quite complex environments.
                <br/><br/>
                Gait is an extraordinarily complex behavior. It involves the entire body and therefore
                requires the coordination of many muscles and joints. Navigating through complex and
                often cluttered environments requires the use of sensory inputs to assist in the control
                and adaptation of gait. Finally, movement behavior includes the ability to initiate and
                terminate movement, to adapt gait to avoid obstacles, and to change speed and direction
                as needed.
                <br/><br/>
                On the foundation of a proper stance and gait, the participants will learn new movements
                to increase their variety of movement choices. Unexpected situations always require a
                wide array of possible solutions of which one can choose.
                <br/><br/>
                Under these considerations it is clear, that more options will lead to better and more
                effective movement behaviours. Besides, being able to move freely inside the
                surrounding environment seems to be obvious. However, if you loose the ability to do so,
                you will definitely miss it.
