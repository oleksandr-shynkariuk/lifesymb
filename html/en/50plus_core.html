                <br/><b>Short Description:</b> The core program is directed to increase the functional
                structure of the muscles in the middle of the body. Especially the abdominals and
                the back will be training during the course. We will also introduce the basic
                principles of the traditional Wing Tsun Kung Fu. This is a very soft and inspiring
                way of gaining confidence and stability.

                Low back pain can be the result of many different things. Pain can be triggered by
                some combination of overuse, muscle strain, and/or injuries to the muscles,
                ligaments, and discs that support the spine. Over time, a muscle injury that has
                not been managed correctly may lead to an overall imbalance in the spine. This
                can lead to constant tension on the muscles, ligaments, bones, making the back
                more prone to injury or re-injury.
                <br/>
                Since low back pain can be caused by injury in various structures in the spine and
                its supporting structures, it is important to consult your physician or athletic
                trainer if you have had back pain lasting longer than 1-2 weeks. Your physician
                can provide a diagnosis and explain what structure is injured so that your
                physical therapist or athletic trainer can guide you as to which exercises are appropriate for your specific injury. Each diagnosis is treated differently, therefore
                it is important that you consult a medical professional before beginning any
                strenuous rehabilitation program. Low back exercises and flexibility can be the
                best treatment option for almost all types of back problems as it is likely to help
                restore balance in the spine.

                <b>Wing Tsun</b>
                <br/>The centrepiece of the Wing Tsun Kung Fu is a unique and multi-faceted
                technique that can be learned only through concentrated practice and conscious
                self-embedding. Flowing movements and sudden quickness go in a systematic
                and coordinated movement into each other: they merge into powerful unit. The
                systematic learning of Wing Tsun increases physical and mental flexibility and
                promotes the perception. The path to that goal is complemented by targeted
                relaxation, concentration techniques and breathing exercises to "recharge" the
                body.
