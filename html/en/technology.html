        The technologies used by LifeSymb are either highly innovative or traditional. We combine the

        At this time we are developing our database. The database makes professional training diagnostic
        and analyses for rehabilitation treatments available for everybody. It also generates training
        recommendations based on this information. These individual recommendations can be executed in
        small groups. Altogether makes up a whole professional training and diagnostic cycle for a small price
        that only sponsored top athletes could use so far.
