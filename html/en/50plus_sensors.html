                <b>Short description:</b> In this course the participants relearn to use their innate
                senses. Different surfaces, unstable ground and balance training is in the focus.
                The activation and training of the senses inside of the skin, makes every step
                more aware and it is the basis for our other courses within the 50+ package.

                    <br/><b>Proprioception is defined as:</b>
                    <br/>Depth perception; kinaesthetic sensibility; perception of position and movement
                    of our body.

                    <br/><b>Proprioception has three qualities:</b>
                    <br/>1.	Sense of position: The positions of our joints are exactly oriented. We can
                    adjust the position of the elbow joint with great accuracy only by
                    considering the position of the other arm (even with closed eyes).
                    <br/>2.	Sense of movement: We perceive the movements of our limbs and joints
                    by our proprioceptors. By doing so, we can control the body parts that are
                    closer to our body better, than the more distant ones.
                    <br/>3.	Sense of force: We must perceive the degree of strength that we apply in
                    order to perform a movement or maintain a joint position.

                When we get born we are only crawling on the ground and perceive our
                surroundings through the sensors in our skin. Muscles and connective tissue
                contain contractile fibres and receptors, which are tiny sensory organs. The
                ability of the body to sense changes in the position of the body is provided by so
                called proprioceptors. During physical injury, stress and threatening or stressful
                events the fibres pull together, which restricts the mobility. At the same time, the
                receptors report an uncomfortable feeling, pain, anxiety, nausea, or paraesthesia.
                <br/>
                Conversely, the organism reacts on positive events with relaxation, mobility and
                well-being. Sensor and motor function, sensing and moving, regulate each other:
                the more discomfort the more tension and the more tension, the more
                paraesthesia.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>Sensorimotor Disturbances</b>
                <br/>Depending on the location of the permanent contraction the temporary
                discomfort develops into massive complaints. These complaints can be:
                <br/>-	Headache and / or dizziness, but also "depressive thoughts" through tension in
                the neck and head muscles
                <br/>-	Knee pain during tension in the back, leg and foot muscles and / or the
                associated connective tissue. These tensions are formed as we raise us in a
                forced self-assertion.
                <br/>-	Bladder complaints occur during tensions in the lower abdomen and pelvic floor
                muscles (usually together with a fear tensioning in the front side of the body)
                <br/>-	Respiratory and / or cardiac disruptions associated with depression or anxiety
                <br/>-	Etc.
                <br/>As we grow older our visual system dominates more and more over all other
                senses and we almost completely unlearn our prior abilities. The nervous system
                underlies the principle of “use it or lose it”. Whenever we stop using our senses,
                we will lose the ability to use them. On the other hand, when we continue using
                them, we can increase the quality of our life tremendously.
                <br/><br/>
                <b>The Sensors Program</b>
                <br/>The Sensors program creates a stable stance and connection to the ground. A
                solid stance and a flawless posture is a fundamental ability for every task in life.
                The perception of a good position of the body in a 3-dimensional room provides
                safety and prevents injuries. Especially in the cold winter months there is
                nothing that can replace the control of the own movements against forces from
                outside.
